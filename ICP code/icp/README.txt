The ICP_m.m file contains two segments of code, the first part is for the ICP process, and the second part responsible for the relevant optimization process.
The function folder contains all *.m files required by the ICP_m.m.
The data folder gives several sets of examples that demonstrate the outcome of the first part of the code (The icp process) and should be used as input for the second part of the code.
(To run the first part of the code, data collection is required.)
To know the detail of icp.m and icp2.m, refer to their origin page:

The output of the ICP_m.m is generated in the output folder as default.
